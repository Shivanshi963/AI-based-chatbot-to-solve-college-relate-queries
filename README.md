💡 How It Works
User opens the chatbot and is greeted with a welcome message.

The user types a query (e.g., “What is the fee for B.Tech?”).

The NLP engine identifies keywords and fetches preloaded data.

The bot responds with appropriate information.

After each response, it politely asks if the user has more questions.

If the user replies “No” or “Thank you”, the chatbot ends the conversation with a goodbye message.
